# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juan ðŸ’»

> I'm entrepreneur, developer, author, speaker, youtuber, and doer of things.

I'm a Software Engineer because I love it! I recently discovered my passion for writing and teaching, which I combined to create Live Code Stream.

Live Code Stream is a blog I built to transmit my knowledge in software engineering, data science and AI for FREE. All the articles here posted are FREE and will remain FREE forever.

I want to help as many people as possible to get started into the world of programming, or to gain a more in depth knowledge of the technologies I'm so passioned about.

Let's connect!
